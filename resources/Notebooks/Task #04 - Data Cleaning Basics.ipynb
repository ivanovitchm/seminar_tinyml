Encodings are systems for representing characters in binary. From the early days of computers, the standard for representing text was called ASCII. The ASCII standard specified a set of 128 standard characters - these were letters, numbers and punctuation marks that were used for the English language. For instance, the letter __a__ in ASCII is represented as **01100001** in binary.\n","\n","ASCII was very useful for the basic letters and numbers in the english language, but as the popularity of computers spread worldwide, different computer manufacturers created new encodings to encode different characters, like the greek character $\\alpha$ or the Japanse character も. Because there wasn't one standard for encodings there were problems when you tried to read files saved using one character set with a computer that used a different character set.\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NzDcepAjvJESItrSbykVB3L9SFdLCLaS\">\n","\n","As a result, there ended up being dozens of different encodings being used throughout the early days of the web. Ideally, the person sending you a file would tell you what encoding it is in, however in reality that rarely happened (and still doesn't). Trying to work out what encoding a file was in was relatively difficult, and you often had to guess.\n","\n","These days, we often still have to guess, however in the last 15 years the number of encodings being commonly used has decreased.
