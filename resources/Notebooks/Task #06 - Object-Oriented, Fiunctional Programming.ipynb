In its simplest definition, procedural programming involves writing code in a number of sequential steps — and sometimes we combine these steps into commands called **functions**.\n","\n","In this chapter, we're going to learn about a new system: **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. Rather than code being designed around sequential steps, it is instead defined around **objects**. For now, you can think of objects as being closely related to variables. We'll learn a more formal definition on the next section.\n","\n",">When working with data, it's much more common to use a style that is closer to procedural programming style than OOP, but it's very important to understand how OOP works, because **Python is an object-oriented language**.\n","\n","This means almost everything in Python is actually an object; when you're working with Python, you are creating and manipulating objects. As you continue to learn to work with data in Python, you'll encounter objects everywhere:\n","\n","  - **NumPy** and **pandas** — the two libraries essential to working with data in Python — both define a number of their own object types.\n","  - **Matplotlib** — which you use to create data visualizations — uses object types to define the charts you create.\n","  - **Scikit-learn** — which you use to create machine learning models — uses object types to represent the models you train and make predictions with.\n","\n","While it's much less common for data scientists and data analysts to define new types of objects, we'll be using objects all the time. Understanding how objects work allows us to better understand what is happening behind the scenes as we work with data.\n","\n","In OOP, objects have types, but instead of \"type\" we use the word **class**. So far, we've been using the word \"type\" to describe different variables:\n","\n","- String type\n","- List type\n","- Dictionary type\n","\n","Technically, the correct name for each of these is:\n","\n","- String class\n","- List class\n","- Dictionary class\n","\n","In everyday English, the word **class** refers to a group of similar things.
